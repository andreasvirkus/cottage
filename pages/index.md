# welcome 👋

Glad to have you in my Small Corner of the Web™.
I'm `Andreas` and I'm very enthusiastic about the magical
[WWW](https://webfoundation.org/about/vision/history-of-the-web/).
This site's main purpose is to act as my personal playground for different web
technologies, but also to provide a bit of insight about [me](/about/).

If you're looking to get in touch, just reach out to me on
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreasvirkus 'View my LinkedIn profile') or via
[e-mail](mailto:write@andreasvirkus.me 'Shoot me an e-mail!').

I'll ~~`Soon™`~~ (<span class="emoji">✔️</span>) also try and write up some
[thoughts](/thoughts/).
They're mostly about lunch-sized development techniques or
explanations of short snippets that I often find useful.
