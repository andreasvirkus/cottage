Taking a chapter from the book of [Max Böck](https://mxb.dev/blog/good-enough/),
I've decided (yet again; this time after a 2 year break) to give this
whole writing show another go (maybe it'll go easier with rhyming involved).

I feel I'll need something more than mere promises this time around, though, if
I am to make this habit stick. Therefore, I'm starting off with a
[series] (`Will Link Soon™`).
<!-- (/thoughts/open-your-mouth-part-1). -->

I've agreed to give my first public talk at the end of November (in just 2 months!)
and think this'll be an excellent journey to document. You'll find more details
about the talk and what the series will be about in the next post (🤞 that we'll
get to it).

Another strategy that I'll try is to keep these posts (at least initially) very
short & casual. They'll be quick recaps about some interesting code
snippets I've put aside this week or general ponderings about the wonderful
~~work~~ life as a developer.

I'll see you all next time.
