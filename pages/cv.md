    Senior Product Developer

    Joined a very early-stage startup as one of the first 2 developers to accompany the technical founder.

Co-lead a team of front-end developers & designers, acting as a task-force in the company, going on missions to help onboard various teams to both implement and contribute back to the component library. A lot of lobbying work and internal knowledge-sharing, educating.

    Helped spin up various loan/debit applications and the accompanying micro-services with Node.js. Optimised the CI/CD pipeline. Helped establish and implement security best-practises. Kicked off and lead a project to share Express-like middlewares between different teams, so new applications could be implemented more quickly for each of the bank's countries (9 in total).

    Towards the end, stayed on as an external consultant to ease the handover process & guide some new exciting experiments with Web components and micro front-ends.

    Front-End Developer

    Maintained a custom WordPress theme-builder, wrote and maintained a script compiler similar to Webpack/Browserify to fine-tune performance of those drag-and-drop sections (jQuery module library of ~200 modules). Advocated for and implemented unit testing for the jQuery modules.

    Helped set up monitoring & benchmarks for accessibility, performance & basic security practises - preaching for CSPs and correct security headers, etc. (before they came a widely known standard as they are today), across a suite of public websites (in 9 countries), the bank's various deposit and loan form applications and self-service applications.

    Campaigned for the need for a universal component-driven framework in our front-end stack. Vetted Angular/React/Vue and decided to bet on Vue in the early days of Vue 2. Kicked off our efforts to move away from outsourced designers to build our own internal design team, that would collaborate tightly with our growing front-end team.
