# tere 🤙

That's `hello` in Estonian.

I'm currently helping [Klaus](https://klausapp.com) conquer
the world of customer support's conversation quality.

When I'm not hanging out with the coolest cat in tech,
I consult others on front-end best practises, help them
execute their next big project or am tinkering on something small (and often silly).

Do let me know if you'd like to collab!\
Either shoot me an [e-mail](mailto:write@andreasvirkus.me) or find me from the onlines 👇
