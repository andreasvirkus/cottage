import { Image } from 'astro:assets'
import qrCode from './qrcode.png'

This is a quick one. A small CSS rule that will come in super handy when you
need to blow up a pixel image (QR code is an excellent example of this)
or you don't know in what size it'll be displayed.

```css
image-rendering: pixelated;
```

This is a QR code in its original size (note how small we can keep the images with this technique!)

<Image src={qrCode} width="48" height="48" alt="A small QR code, sharp quality" />

And now this is the same image scaled up (both are full-width, so make sure to stretch out your browser to see how the effect scales), but the second image has `image-rendering` set to `pixelated`.

<Image src={qrCode} style="width:100%" alt="A very large QR code, with blurry quality" />

Now that's better ðŸ‘‡

<Image src={qrCode} style="width:100%; image-rendering: pixelated" alt="A very large QR code, but still with sharp quality thanks to the pixelated CSS property"  />
