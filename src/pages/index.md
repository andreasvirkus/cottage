# welcome

Glad to have you in my small Corner of the Webâ„¢.
I'm `Andreas` and I'm very enthusiastic about the magical
[WWW](https://webfoundation.org/about/vision/history-of-the-web/).
This site's main purpose is to act as my personal playground for different web
technologies, but also to provide a bit of insight about [/me](/about/).

If you're looking to get in touch, just reach out to me on
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreasvirkus 'View my LinkedIn profile') or via
[e-mail](mailto:write@andreasvirkus.me 'Shoot me an e-mail!').

I sometimes also write short posts about small development techniques or
explanations of short snippets that I often find useful. You can read about them in [/thoughts](/thoughts/).
