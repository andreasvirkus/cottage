So I faced an interesting problem the other day, where
I discovered my CV's downloadable PDF link isn't indexed (aka included in my
`sitemap.xml` file). And it [should be](https://www.thewebmaster.com/seo/2016/feb/24/google-we-index-pdfs-just-like-any-other-web-page/).

To achieve that, I'll run you through a snippet to append it as an entry to the sitemap.
The way we'll go through this is to first set up a basic working node module and
then later also turn it into a Metalsmith plugin.

### Node module

We'll need Node's native `fs` and `path` modules and also the file's name
(which you can later make dynamic, but currently we'll settle for the default
`sitemap.xml` value).

```js
const fs = require('fs')
const path = require('path')
const fileName = 'sitemap.xml'
```

Next we'll define the sitemap's closing tag, so we could replace the length of it
when we write to the file later (you'll hear more 'bout it in a bit).

```js
const closingTag = '</urlset>'
```

Then we'll go ahead and create a buffer containing our new content (the line
we're appending) and the closing tag we just defined
...aand we also need to know the file's path and size.

```js
let content = `<url> <loc>https://andreasvirkus.me/assets/cv/CV-Andreas-Johan-Virkus.pdf</loc> </url>`,
  buffer = new Buffer(content + '\n' + closingTag),
  filePath = path.join(__dirname, '..', 'dist', fileName),
  fileSize = fs.statSync(filePath)['size']
```

Now all that's left to do is to open up the `XML` file and replace the
end of the file (length of the closing tag) with our freshly defined buffer:

```js
fs.open(filePath, 'r+', (err, fd) => {
  // File was most likely not found or we don't have permission to write
  if (err) throw err

  fs.write(fd, buffer, 0, buffer.length, fileSize - closingTag.length, (err) => {
    if (err) throw err
  })
})
```

### Result

So what we've got so far is this:

```js
// appendToSitemap.js

const fs = require('fs')
const path = require('path')
const fileName = 'sitemap.xml'
const closingTag = '</urlset>'

let content = `<url> <loc>https://andreasvirkus.me/assets/cv/CV-Andreas-Johan-Virkus.pdf</loc> </url>`,
  buffer = new Buffer(content + '\n' + closingTag),
  filePath = path.join(__dirname, '..', 'dist', fileName),
  fileSize = fs.statSync(filePath)['size']

fs.open(filePath, 'r+', (err, fd) => {
  fs.write(fd, buffer, 0, buffer.length, fileSize - closingTag.length, (err) => {
    if (err) throw err
  })
})
```

Now we can run it as any other Node script: `node appendToSitemap.js` and
it should add our `content` variable as the last entry of the file's `urlset`.

### Bringing in Metalsmith

Since I wish to automate this process, I'll add it to my Metalsmith
build's callback as a module:

```js
const fs = require('fs')
const path = require('path')
const fileName = 'sitemap.xml'
const closingTag = '</urlset>'

module.exports = function (content) {
  let buffer = new Buffer(content + '\n' + closingTag),
    filePath = path.join(__dirname, '..', 'dist', fileName),
    fileSize = fs.statSync(filePath)['size']

  fs.open(filePath, 'r+', (err, fd) => {
    fs.write(fd, buffer, 0, buffer.length, fileSize - closingTag.length, (err) => {
      if (err) throw err
    })
  })
}
```

And I can call it in my `build.js` file:

```js
metalsmith(__dirname).source('./src').destination('./dist').clean(true)
/**
 * Using any amount of plugins here
 * ...
 */ s.build(function (err) {
  if (err) throw err

  // Update sitemap
  appendToSitemap(`<url> <loc>https://andreasvirkus.me/assets/cv/CV-Andreas-Johan-Virkus.pdf</loc> </url>`)
})
```
