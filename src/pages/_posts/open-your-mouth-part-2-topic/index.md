Welcome back to my journey of giving my first ever public talk.
In order for me to give a talk, I'll need something to talk _about_.

Common sense tells me that people will find your talk
more attractive and easier to listen to when you're passionate
about the topic.

Ideally, you'd want to convey a message and not just a technical detail.

Do not be afraid of the questions in the end - take them as
a vibrant community discussion (where you just happen to be able to help out)


> I've always felt that a person's intelligence is directly reflected by the number of conflicting points of view he can entertain simultaneously on the same topic.

- Abigail Adams

I'll see you all next time, when we lay down the structure of our talk.
