Every now and then, a blog will come across a need to quote someone or maybe
display a code snippet or two. Markdown, being the solid fella that it is,
takes care of generating the markup for us. But it's up to us to also carry
that semantic meaning over to the end user through visual means.

Since I lack content for the blog at this day and age, I thought, instead of
creating a temporary filler site, styling the elements, and then deleting it,
I'd leave the elements and their evolution of styles here for future reference
in the form of a blog post.

So let's run through some rudimentary elements essential for a half-decent blog!

**Edit** This also turned out to be very useful whilst refactoring this site from
[Metalsmith to Vuepress]() (and I'd imagine likewise for a style makeover).

We'll start off with some headings

# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

And a content link style with sexy underlines - [Gargoyle Gigglypuff jamming it out](https://andreasvirkus.me)

- A
  - Deeply
  - Nested
- List
- Of
- Sorts

1. And an ordered
2. List with
3. Some numbers

A default line separator, which I like using a little too often

<hr>

Now let's quote someone with questionable views:

> Normality is a waste of potential.
>
> &mdash; Me

Then some default text styles (content by the ever-amusing [hipsum](https://hipsum.co)):

<hr>

And now some code blocks:

```js
const pi = 'I never remembered it ðŸ˜¶';
```

We can even have them

``` html
<h2>with <u>different</u> syntaxes</h2>
```

``` css
body {
  /* Someone's going to jail for this */
  display: none !important;
}
```

Also the `<kbd>` element is great for writing inline styles!

~~Down the road, we'll add syntax highlighting with PrismJS to Metalsmith.~~ (covered by migrating to Vuepress)
