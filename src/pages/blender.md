# blender

I started learning blender in September 2021, to have something to tinker with
in my free hours. It's purpose is to give my brain a break from coding projects, yet still somehow
challenge it in creative ways. My working theory is this will help me prevent burnout ðŸ¤ž.

I've been a long-time fan of [Ian Hubert](https://www.youtube.com/c/mrdodobird), [Captain Disillusion](https://www.youtube.com/c/CaptainDisillusion),
the [Corridor Crew](https://www.youtube.com/c/corridorcrew) and it's truly exciting to embark upon this journey. Below you can find some
of my early attempts at rendering things.
