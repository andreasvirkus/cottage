# me

Let me rant about myself for a bit. My full _curriculum vitae_ can be viewed [here](/cv/). You can skip ahead to my [passions](#interests) or my [work](#labor).

In my free time I enjoy climbing, working on my motorcycle, disc golfing, BJJ & learning Blender...
and starring [GitHub repos](https://github.com/andreasvirkus?tab=stars) ‚≠ê.

## interests

I'm a developer with a soft spot for front-end. I'm interested in all kinds of visual communication, but my major focus is on designing web applications & interfaces. I love (and preach) all things JavaScript, semantic HTML, the power of CSS & progressive enhancement. Lately I've really enjoyed tinkering with:

- Blender
- Vue.js & Nuxt ‚ô•
  - Pruvious
- Metalsmith, Eleventy, Vitepress, Astro ‚ô•
- Edge functions & edge rendering
- Golang
- ESM build tools (Vite, Bun, ESBuild)

I work great with designers (challenging their perspective on things),
other devs & _less-techy folk_ (pretty sure that's the technical term for it).

## labor

\* Unfortunately, I can't show most of my past work on here for [legal reasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement).
It's good stuff though.

I like fiddling small components and scripts on [codepen](https://codepen.io/ajv/pens/popular), [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/user/andreasvirkus/fiddles/), [gist](https://gist.github.com/andreasvirkus/) and on my [Arduino](https://github.com/andreasvirkus)/Pi.\
I started out creating websites for neighbours, family friends and small companies, which really sparked a passion. Here's what I've been up to since:

### [Supersimple](https://supersimple.io?utm_source=andreasvirkus.me) üêß

Helping Supersimple simplify complex data exploration flows and
aiding all roles of any SaaS company to have swift answers for
their burning curiosity.

### [Zendesk QA](https://www.zendesk.com/service/workforce-engagement-management/?utm_source=andreasvirkus.me)

<div style="margin-top: -1rem">January 2024 ‚Äì May 2024</div>

Klaus got acquired! üôÄ I helped ensure a smooth transition for the
developer teams and make sure everyone got settled, but knew a
company of that size would be too big a place for me.

### [Klaus](https://klausapp.com?utm_source=andreasvirkus.me) üêà‚Äç‚¨õ

#### Technical lead

<div style="margin-top: -1rem">April 2022 ‚Äì May 2024</div>

Grew our front-end team from 1 (me) to 9. Helped set up Shaping and organised hackathons, product initiatives and
shaped the engineering team culture.

#### Product engineer

<div style="margin-top: -1rem">July 2018 - April 2022</div>

Klaus is a SaaS product that lets customer support agents conduct
conversation reviews. Besides the main app, I also wrote and
managed Klaus' [browser extensions](https://klausapp.com/browser-extension),
a Zendesk app and a couple of other small widgets. I advocate
open-source, best practises, progressive enhancement and security to
the best of my abilities and try to integrate them into the
developer culture that we are still shaping.

### [Bigbank](https://bigbank.com)

### **Technical consultant**

<div style="margin-top: -1rem">July 2018 ‚Äì June 2019</div>

### Front-end developer

<div style="margin-top: -1rem">July 2015 ‚Äì July 2018</div>

I started out supporting an in-house Wordpress theme, helping marketers create pages
with a page builder. Worked with the design team to unify the corporate visuals
across multiple countries and platforms (also implemented a pattern library).
I then shifted bit more towards Node's full-stack world and worked with microservices
and the Wordpress REST API to render its contents as a separate Vue application.
I've learned heaps about virtualisation, dockerisation, CI & CD, security,
authentication, and too much about front-end itself to even list.\
My last product in the company was a Vue-based component library, coupled with
an in-house Express middleware and some internal `vue-cli@3` plugins to help developers
quickly spin up new applications & product instances.

### Saue high school

#### Programming teacher

<div style="margin-top: -1rem">Autumn 2015 ‚Äì Spring 2016</div>

My job was to give my students a basic understanding of the principles of
programming, whilst keeping it a fun learning experience. I teach Python
mostly through games and active user input, so their first experience
with programming wouldn't be stale.

### Freelance

<div style="margin-top: -1rem">Started 2014</div>

Programming has long been an interest of mine. Having also a soft spot
for the artsy side in me‚Äîfront-end development seemed like an excellent
field to start gaining some experience. From simple websites and company
home pages, I've grown to enjoy experimenting with audiovisual experiences
and a bit more artsy projects.
