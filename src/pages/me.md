# me

I'm not much of a talker, but let me rant about myself for a bit. You can skip ahead to:

- my [passions](#superpowers)
- overview about my [education](#education)
- or my [work](#labor).

My full _curriculum vitae_ can be viewed [here](/cv/).

## superpowers

I'm an aspiring full-stack developer (with a front-ended tilt). I'm interested in all kinds of visual communication, but my major focus is on designing web applications & interfaces. I love (and preach) all things JavaScript, semantic HTML, the power of CSS & progressive enhancement. Lately I've really enjoyed tinkering with:

- Blender
- Vue.js ♥
- Svelte ♥
- PWAs and service-workers
- Various bundlers, with a focus on bundling & performance optimisations
- Headless CMS-s and Static-site generators
  - Metalsmith
  - ~~Vuepress~~ ~~Vitepress~~ Astro ♥
  - Eleventy
  - Saber
  - Gridsome
- Serverless
- Golang
- ESM build tools (Vite, Snowpack, Bun, ESBuild)

I work great with designers (challenging their perspective on things),
other devs & _less-techy folk_ (pretty sure that's the technical term for it).

I've also dabbled in other fields (and hope to perfect them in the future), like:

- automation & shell scripting
- web performance
- CI & CD
- agile thinking & rapid iteration
- accessibility
- security
- UNIX-based systems
- dockerisation, Kubernetes
- UX & user flow
- interaction design

## education

Being a self-claimed autodidact, I consider myself a proud drop out. Instead
of going the standard university route (BSc, MSc, internships, etc.), I pivoted and spent
my time tinkering on small private projects, reading books & articles and listening to podcasts.

My biggest educational growth though came from the first few months at my first job
and I believe my hunger for knowledge has sky-rocketed ever since. I also love
meetups and conferences (...it's the free stickers) and have talked at a few.

If you care about the more _official_ part of this, here's a rundown:

- **CS at Tallinn University of Technology**
  - quit June 2015
  - I in no way mean to bad-mouth, but the (at the time) outdated curriculum and narrow-minded teachers left me wanting more. I've listed the relevant completed
    courses under my LinkedIn profile.
- **Hardcore developer training at PluralSight**
  - attended May 2015
  - A thorough overview of a web developer's stack before PluralSight expanded
    their training courses.
- **Certificate in Full Stack Development at Free Code Camp**
  - Spring 2015
- **Exact Science Field at Old Town Educational College** (Secondary education)
  - Graduated June 2012

## labor

I like fiddling small components and scripts on [codepen](https://codepen.io/ajv/pens/popular), [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/user/andreasvirkus/fiddles/), [gist](https://gist.github.com/andreasvirkus/) and on my [Arduino](https://github.com/andreasvirkus).

\* Unfortunately, I can't show most of my past work on here for [legal reasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement).
It's good stuff though.

I started out creating websites for neighbours and small companies, which really sparked a passion. Here's what I've been up to since:

### [Klaus](https://klausapp.com?utm_source=andreasvirkus.me)

#### Technical lead

<span style="font-size:85%">April 2022</span>

Grew our front-end team from 1 (me) to 9. Helped set up Shaping and organised hackathons, product initiatives and
shaped the engineering team culture.

#### Product engineer

<span style="font-size:85%">July 2018 - April 2022</span>

Klaus is a SaaS product that lets customer support agents conduct
conversation reviews. Besides the main app, I also wrote and
manage Klaus' [browser extensions](https://klausapp.com/browser-extension),
a Zendesk app and a couple of other small widgets. I advocate
open-source, best practises, progressive enhancement and security to
the best of my abilities and try to integrate them into the
developer culture that we are still shaping.

### [Bigbank](https://bigbank.com)

### **Technical consultant @ Bigbank**

<span style="font-size:85%">July 2018 – June 2019</span>

### Front-end developer

<span style="font-size:85%">July 2015 – July 2018</span>

I started out supporting an in-house Wordpress theme, helping marketers create pages
with a page builder. Worked with the design team to unify the corporate visuals
across multiple countries and platforms (also implemented a pattern library).
I then shifted bit more towards Node's full-stack world and worked with microservices
and the Wordpress REST API to render its contents as a separate Vue application.
I've learned heaps about virtualisation, dockerisation, CI & CD, security,
authentication, and too much about front-end itself to even list.\
My last product in the company was a Vue-based component library, coupled with
an in-house Express middleware and some internal `vue-cli@3` plugins to help developers
quickly spin up new applications & product instances.

### Saue high school

#### Programming teacher

<span style="font-size:85%">Autumn 2015 – Spring 2016</span>

My job was to give my students a basic understanding of the principles of
programming, whilst keeping it a fun learning experience. I teach Python
mostly through games and active user input, so their first experience
with programming wouldn't be stale.

### Freelance

<span style="font-size:85%">Started 2014</span>

Programming has long been an interest of mine. Having also a soft spot
for the artsy side in me—front-end development seemed like an excellent
field to start gaining some experience.

In my free time I enjoy working on my motorcycle, disc golfing, learning BJJ & Blender,
bouldering... and starring [GitHub repos](https://github.com/andreasvirkus?tab=stars) ⭐.
